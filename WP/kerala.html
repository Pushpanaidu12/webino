<h1 style="color:red; " ><i><u><center>  KERALA  TOURISM PACKAGE </center></h1></i></u>
<p style="font-size:22px;color:black;">Kerala, a state on India's tropical Malabar Coast, has nearly 600km of Arabian Sea shoreline. It's known for its palm-lined beaches and its backwaters, a network of canals popular for cruises. Its many upscale seaside resorts include specialists in Ayurvedic treatments. Inland are the Western Ghats, a mountain range whose slopes support tea, coffee and spice plantations as well as abundant native wildlife.
