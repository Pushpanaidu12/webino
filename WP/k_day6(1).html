Get transferred to Srinagar airport to board your flight for respective hub.

Due to the extremely strict security measures at the airport during peak season, guests are requested to leave for the airport at least 4 hours prior to departure. We are forced to enforce this rule as there are 4 security barriers to pass before reaching the airport. Also, there are regular traffic jams for a couple of kilometers outside the airport.
