<h4>The yatra to Mata Vaishno Devi shrine is one of the holiest and the most arduous pilgrimages for Hindus all over the world. The shrine is at an altitude of 5,300 feet and is about 14 kilometres from Katra. The trek is not an easy one as the hills are steep and requires a lot of stamina and fitness. Instilled with a belief that Mata Vaishno Devi grants wishes to those who seek her blessings, from newlyweds to old couples, everyone undertakes this yatra.

Over the years, the facilities along the route to the holy shrine have made the journey comfortable. For the elderly and those of ill health, mule and pony rides are available to negotiate the steep incline. Furthermore, pilgrims can also avail helicopter services from Katra and Jammu to Sanjichat. Sanjichat is the highest point on the trekking route of Vaishno Devi. The Bhawan is a downhill trek of about 2.5 km from Sanjichat. Pure vegetarian food stalls and hygienic outlets are available at regular intervals so the pilgrims do not face any hassle during their journey.

The yatra and the route remain open for the pilgrims throughout the year. The most popular time to undertake the darshan is during the festive and auspicious time of the Navratras.
