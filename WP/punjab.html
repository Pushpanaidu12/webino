<p style="font-size:19px">Punjab, a state bordering Pakistan, is the heart of India’s Sikh community. Its city of Amritsar, founded in 1577 by Sikh guru Ram Das, is the site of Harmandir Sahib, the holiest gurdwara (Sikh temple). Pilgrims visit its gilded Hari Mandir sanctuary and bathe in the surrounding Pool of Nectar. Also in Amritsar is Durgiana Temple, a Hindu shrine with engraved silver doors</p>
